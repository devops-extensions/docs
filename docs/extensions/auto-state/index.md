## Information about the New Boards Hub feature

:::caution Information about the New Boards Hub feature

This extension does not work if you have the `New Boards Hub` feature enabled. When this preview feature is enabled, certain contributions from this extension is not loaded. Microsoft says that they are "Optimizing" the feature, so all I can do is wait until this feature comes out of preview.

This issue is being tracked:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/joachimdalen/azdevops-auto-state/issues/17)

## About

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

An issue I often face is forgetting to update the state of a parent workitem when starting a new Task. This extension aims to auto update parent workitems based on a set of rules when the child workitem is started.
